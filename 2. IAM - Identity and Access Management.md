- Global service since we are going to create users and assign them to groups
- When we created the account, we created the **root** account. The only thing you should use it for is to set up your IAM account.
- Users can be grouped together
- Groups can only contain users, not other groups
- A user can belong to multiple groups
- A user doesn't have to be allocated to a group but that is not good practice
![Example of groups](Images/IAM_groups.png)
- Users or groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies that gives the user permissions 
- You apply the **least privilege principle**. Don't give more permission than a user needs
- Each user will inherit policies based on their group type. If they are not in a group, they will inherit the inline policies

## IAM MFA
- Prevent accounts from being compromised
- In AWS you can set your own password policy:
  - Set a minimum password length
  - Require specific character types including
    - uppercase letter
    - lowercase letter
    - numbers
    - non-alphanumeric characters
  - Go to IAM > Account Settings under `Access Management` and you can modify your Password Policy there.
  - Allow all IAM users to change their own passwords
  - Require users to change their passwords after some time (for eg 90 days)
  - Prevent password re-use
- Types of MFA device options in AWS
  - Virtual MFA Device (Authenticators). Support for multiple tokens on a single device
    - Google Authenticator (phone only)
    - Authy (multi-device)
  - Universal 2 Factor (U2F) Security Key. Support for multiple root and IAM users using a single security key
    - Yubikey by Yubico (3rd party key)
  - Hardware Key Fob MFA device
    - Provided by Gemalto (3rd party)
  - Hardware Key Fob MFA Device for AWS GovCloud (US) if you are using AWS for government
    - Provided by SurePassID

## AWS Access Keys, CLI and SDK
### How can users access AWS?
1. AWS Management Console (protected by password + MFA)
2. AWS Command Line Interface (CLI): protected by access keys
3. AWS Software Developer Kit (SDK) for code: protected by access keys

- Access Keys are generated through the AWS console
- Users manage their own access keys

[!IMPORTANT]  
Access Keys are secret, just like your password. Don't share them. 

### What's the AWS CLI?
- A tool that enables you to interact with AWS services using commands in your command-line shell
- Direct access to the public APIs of AWS Services
- You can develop scripts to manage resources
- It's open sourced https://www.github.com/aws/aws-cli/
- Alternative to using the AWS management console

### What's the AWS SDK?
- Language-specific APIs (set of libraries)
- Enables you to access and manage AWS services programmatically. 
- It is not something you use within your terminal, it is something you embed into your application when you code. 
- Supports multiple languages: JavaScript, Python, Go, PHP, .NET, Ruby, Java, NodeJS, C++
